== Key Features of the Membership for WooCommerce Plugin ==

WooCommerce store owners already have so much to handle. And we want to simplify things for you to the bare minimum. So, we exhibit to you the most appropriate and must-have features for your membership website. This WooCommerce Membership free plugin brings you:

**1) Offer Free Trial and Sign-Up Fee:** The WooCommerce Membership plugin lets you offer a free trial for memberships while charging an initial sign-up fee, helping you attract more customers with a risk-free trial while generating upfront revenue. Customers can pay the sign-up fee, enjoy the free trial, and their membership will automatically start as a paid plan once the trial ends. 
Note: This feature requires the Subscription for WooCommerce plugin to work.
**2) Members Dashboard:** A "Membership Details" tab has been added to the My Account section, giving customers easy access to important details like total discounts earned, Active Subscriptions and membership information. This feature enhances user experience by providing a centralized view of their membership benefits.

**3) New Membership Plan Page Template:** We've added a new membership offer page with a better design and clearer information. It now includes a collapsible section where users can click an arrow to show or hide the membership details. This makes it easier for customers to see what they need, helping them decide faster and improving conversions.

**4) New Membership Details Layout:** A new layout has been introduced for the membership details page in the "My Account" section. You can apply this new layout and customize the colors of the membership details to match your preferences.

**5) Redirect Users Upon Registration:** Using Membership with WooCommerce plugin improves user experience by smoothly redirecting users to your chosen page when they sign up. Activate the option, pick your desired page—whether it's the Cart, Membership Plan, My Account, or any other page—and create a more personalized onboarding journey.

**6) Membership Details and Plan Creation:** In the WordPress Membership Plugin admin can display offered products and product categories in a membership plan. Those products and categories can only be accessible to users if they have purchased the WooCommerce membership plan. Admin is completely entitled to the creation and detailing of WooCommerce membership plans like:

* Plan price
* Plan name
* Plan Description
* Access Type (Lifetime or Limited accessibility) 

**7) User Table for Admin:** In WooCommerce Membership Plugin instead, metadata will be saved and displayed in the user table as member type.

**8) Filter Member According to Membership Plan and Column Added in Members Table:** Admin can allow their members to filter members by membership plans. This will help you to find the details of members according to the plans. Go to all members, click on the filter by membership plan, and find the customer.

**9) Filter Member According to Status** Using Membership with WooCommerce plugin, you can filter members by status. You can filter the member by the status of their product. Go to all members and click on the filter by status, select the status, and the list of that particular status will open in the table form from there you can find the individual member.


**10) Individual Product Membership Plan:** Admin can provide the membership plans on individual products or categories. For example: Among the outfits, the store owners only provided the plan for a single product of clothing like a polo T-shirt.

**11) Discount On Membership User Cart Total:** With WooCommerce membership, free admin can apply discounts based on user roles. Give discounts only to WooCommerce membership users. Admin can grant discounts to his WooCommerce membership customers on total cart value and even offer them free shipping as per their membership plans. This discount can be fixed or percentage-based. Entirely the admin’s choice. 

**12) One-time Discount Coupon For New Members:** Using Membership with WooCommerce plugin, you can create discount coupons exclusively for new members. After new users sign up on your website and buy a membership, they'll receive an email with their unique coupon, granting them discounts on their membership plan.

**13) Show Header and Footer on Membership Plan Page:** Membership for WooCommerce plugin has the option to show the header and footer on the membership plans page. Showing header and footer on the membership plan page can provide consistent branding and navigation for users, making it easier for them to understand and navigate the website.

**14) Send Quick Notifications to All Users:** The WooCommerce Membership plugin allows you to send email notifications to your users in bulk. You can send emails regarding any subject you deem worthy. For example, new membership plan launches, offers, Woo membership discounts, etc.

**15) Allow Your Members to Cancel their Membership Accounts:** Using WooCommerce Membership free plugin admin can allow their members to cancel their membership anytime. Simple WooCommerce Membership allows users to discontinue their plan whenever they want. Enable the setting in general settings and your customers will get access to cancel your plan.

**16) Perfectly Neat Shortcodes For Your WooCommerce Membership Plan Page Customization:** WordPress Membership Plugin provides the admin with a remarkable collection of shortcodes that work not only on purchasing the default WooCommerce membership plan but also on the WooCommerce memberships custom page. Admin can design their plan page at ease with membership action shortcodes and membership plan shortcodes. They are for the admin’s utter convenience.

**17) Complete User Membership History and WooCommerce Membership Details of Customers:** Admin gets a quick preview section for WooCommerce Membership plans on the plans listing page. The Woo membership users can see their history in the ‘My Account’ section with the entire details of their membership plans. This will also show their WooCommerce membership details like the due date of their membership plan, their payment status, etc.

**18) Membership User Data Export and Import:** Store owners can effortlessly export the WooCommerce membership plans along with the user data and its related settings. Similarly, the admin can also import the details of all WooCommerce membership users as a CSV file. 
Admin can also import the WooCommerce membership plans and successfully apply this import if the CSV file products are available in the store. Otherwise, it will fail. Admin can delete the plugin data on the plugin and uninstall the plugin from the database.

**19) APIs for Membership Offer Details and Purchased Membership Plans:** The WooCommerce membership plugin offers APIs to fetch details about active membership plans (Membership ID, Name, Type, Price, & Duration) and purchased memberships by any user (Membership ID, Name, Price, Validity, Duration, & Status). Apply the required parameters along with the API secret key and show these details in any web application, desktop application, mobile application, scripting language, or API documentation.

**20) Multi-Step Configuration of Membership for WooCommerce:** With a multi-step configuration on installing the plugin, the admin gets assistance in creating his first membership plan. The home tab is also included according to the plugin configuration concept.

**21) Create User After Payment Done:** Using the  WooCommerce Membership Free Plugin, the admin can create a user after completing the payment. No default member will be created on your WooCommerce store immediately after the membership purchase. This setting can be enabled or disabled anytime from the general setting. Offer members-only individual product discounts and increase customer loyalty and engagement rate.

**22) Create Membership in the Order Processing Stage:** You can enroll users into your membership plans even when their membership order is in the processing stage. It allows you to quickly create new members for your site’s programs.

**23) The Buy Now Button Text Can Be Changed To Dynamic Text:** With Membership plugin store owners can now give the dynamic look to the Buy Now Button by changing it into a different format. For example: Purchase Now, Grab Now, and many more.

**24) Addition of Quick Status Update in Member Table:** Admin can change the status directly from the member table if the status is pending. Else status is changed from an individual product. Go to all members and click on pending statuses to change the status directly.
