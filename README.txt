WooCommerce store owners already have so much to handle. And we want to simplify things for you to the bare minimum. So, we exhibit to you the most appropriate and must-have features for your membership website. This free Membership plugin brings you:

**1) Allow Your Members to Cancel their Membership Accounts**
Admin can allow their members to cancel their membership anytime. Membership for WooCommerce allows users to discontinue their plan whenever they want too. Enable the setting in general settings and your customers will get access to cancel your plan

**2) Buy Now Button Text Can Be Changed To Dynamic Text**
Store owners can now give the dynamic look to the Buy Now Button by changing it into a different format. For example: Purchase Now, Grab Now, and many more

**3) Individual Product Membership Plan**
Admin can provide the membership plans on individual products or categories. For example: Among the outfits, the store owner only provided the plan on the single product of clothing like a polo T-shirt.

**4) Complete User Membership History and WooCommerce Membership Details of Customers**
Admin gets a quick preview section for WooCommerce Membership plans on the plans listing page. The Woo membership users too can see their history in the ‘My Account’ section with entire details of their membership plans. This will also show their WooCommerce membership details like the due date of their membership plan, their payment status, etc.

**5) Membership User Data Export and Import**
Store owners can effortlessly export the WooCommerce membership plans along with the user data and its related settings. Similarly, the admin can also import the details of all WooCommerce membership users as a CSV file. 

Admin can also import the WooCommerce membership plans and successfully apply this import if the CSV file products are available in the store. Otherwise, it will fail. Admin can delete the plugin data on the plugin and uninstall the plugin from the database.  

**6) Perfectly Neat Shortcodes For Your WooCommerce Membership Plan Page Customization**
We provide the admin with a remarkable collection of shortcodes that work not only on purchasing the default WooCommerce membership plan but also on the WooCommerce memberships custom page. Admin can design their plan page at ease with membership action shortcodes and membership plan shortcodes. They are for the admin’s utter convenience.

**7) Discount On Membership User Cart Total**
Admin can apply discounts based on user roles. Give discounts only to the WooCommerce membership users. Admin can grant discounts to his WooCommerce membership customers on total cart value and even offer them free shipping as per their membership plans. This discount can be fixed or percentage-based. Entirely the admin’s choice. 

**8) User Table for Admin**
Now members will not be assigned roles. Instead, metadata will be saved and displayed in the user table as member type.

**9) Multi-Step Configuration of Membership for WooCommerce**
With a multi-step configuration on installing the plugin, the admin gets assistance in creating his first membership plan. The home tab is also included according to the plugin configuration concept.

**10)  Display All Membership Plans Together With Option to Buy Them**
The membership plans page displays all membership plans created in your eCommerce store with their respective prices. The users can directly buy membership plans from here.       

**11) Membership Details and Plan Creation**
Admin can display offered products and product categories in a membership plan. Those products and categories can only be accessible to users if they have purchased the WooCommerce membership plan. Admin is completely entitled to the creation and detailing of WooCommerce membership plan like:
* Plan price
* Plan name
* Plan description
* Access Type (Lifetime or Limited accessibility) 

**12) Create User After Payment Done** 
Using the free Membership for WooCommerce plugin, the admin can create a user after completing the payment. No default member will be created on your WooCommerce store immediately after membership purchase. This setting can be enabled or disabled anytime from the general setting.
